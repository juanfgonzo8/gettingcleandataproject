# Getting and Cleaning Data course project
Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The main script "run_analysis.R" does all of the processes needed to download, load, transform, and save the datasets.
The only that is needed is to run the script on the working directory of choose.
A problem might be encountered if the script is executed in a Windows machine because the paths are only valid in MacOS or Linux.
The codebook with the variables can also be found in the repository.
